SOURCES:
ChatGPT: Questions like "How would I ____?", "Is there a function that ____?", and "Explain ____ in racket" were some of my best friends.
Beautiful Racket: https://beautifulracket.com, simple explanations of certain things in racket, like boolean expressions, for someone who doesn't understand racket
Racket Docs: https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/strings.html, needed a lot of help on string splitting and comparisons so what I couldn't pull from beautiful racket I got from here.
